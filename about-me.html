        <h1 class="page-title">About Me</h1>
        <div class="about-me">
        
            <p>I am Jarence. I graduated from the University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City with a Bachelor's Degree in Geodetic
                Engineering. My core expertise is in mapping, geospatial analysis, and remote sensing. Because of this background,
                I am able to handle a wide range of geospatial tasks. I am familiar and comfortable in handling geospatial data
                (including earth observation data; e.g., satellite imagery), manipulating them, and performing analysis to generate and
                derive actionable insights. I am well-versed in using various geospatial software, such as ArcGIS, QGIS, and
                Google Earth Engine, to create and visualize geospatial data through maps.</p>
        
            <p>Currently, I am taking up my Master's Degree in Geomatics specializing in Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry at the University
                of the Philippines Diliman while working full-time as a researcher at the same university. My current interests
                also include systems development, spatial data science, and automation. I am comfortable in using Python and R for
                geospatial analysis. I am strongly inclined to use my skills in the field of environmental monitoring and
                conservation.</p>
        
            <p>Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I try a variety of things. Some of my favorite hobbies include
                watching animated series and playing video games. I also enjoy playing sports and music.</p>
