# My Portfolio

Hi! I am **Jarence**, a geospatial and remote sensing analyst. Primarily, I do mapping and earth observation analysis using satellites. On the side, I also dabble in programming for (spatial) data analysis and systems development. Recently, I have been learning spatial statistics and software development. I have a strong interest in learning more about spatial data science and AI mainly for environmental monitoring and conservation.
