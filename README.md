# My Portfolio

Hi! I am **Jarence**. Nice to see you here!

I am a `researcher, geospatial engineer/developer, and remote sensing scientist`. I primarily do mapping of various geospatial data and earth observation analysis, mostly using satellites. On the side, I also dabble in programming for (spatial) data analysis and systems development. Recently, I have been learning geospatial database management, spatial statistics, and software development. I have a strong interest in learning more about spatial data science and AI/ML mainly for environmental monitoring and conservation.

I have a degree in engineering and am currently taking up my M. Sc. degree.
