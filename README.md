_**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!**_

# My Portfolio

Hi! I am **Jarence**. I am a geospatial and remote sensing analyst. I primarily do mapping and earth observation analysis, mostly using satellites. On the side, I also dabble in programming for (spatial) data analysis and systems development. Recently, I have been learning spatial statistics and software development. I have a strong interest in learning more about spatial data science and AI mainly for environmental monitoring and conservation.

I have a degree in engineering and am currently taking up my M. Sc. degree.
