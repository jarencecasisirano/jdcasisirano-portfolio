# My Portfolio

Hi! I am **Jarence**. I am a geospatial and programming enthusiast. I do mapping, remote sensing, and most recently, I am learning systems development and spatial statistics. I have strong interest towards learning more about spatial data science and AI mainly for environmental monitoring and conservation.
